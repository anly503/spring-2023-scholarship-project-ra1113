# The Data Job Market in the US {#home}



```{python}
#| echo: false

# libraries
from IPython.display import display, HTML, IFrame

```

## Introduction {#introduction}

The job market in the US has been quite unstable recently, with companies, especially technology ones, firing employees left, right and center in order to reduce costs and reduce human power. Furthermore, widespread inflation in the US has led to jobs overpaying several employees, which is another contributing factor to mass layoffs in the technology sector. This project is an attempt to portray a deep dive into the job market in the US, by means of effective data visualizations. We will explore several features of jobs, including their salary, experience, qualifications, and locations, and we will do this in a visually informative manner. For this project, I have chosen a dark and red theme to elucidate the unease and stress experienced around entering the work force. I hope you enjoy my project. 


## What Jobs? Where do they come from?

### Bar Plot of the top 5 Cities with their Counts {#sec-bar-plot-1 .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-bar-plot-1
#| fig-cap: "shows an interactive table with a dropdown allowing the selection of assets, equity, or liabilities. Given the static nature of this website, the table is sorted only by Equity."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-1.html', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```


## How much?

Now, we will explore the average salaries and experience required for data-related jobs, for each state. @fig-interactive-table:

#### **Table of US Bank Assets, Equity And Liabilities Per State as of 2022Q4** {#sec-interactive-table .unnumbered}

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-interactive-table
#| fig-cap: "shows an interactive table with a dropdown allowing the selection of assets, equity, or liabilities. Given the static nature of this website, the table is sorted only by Equity."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/table.html', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```

::: {.callout-note}
Using this **interactive data table**, we can obtain a broad view of the US banking system size by several metrics, setting the stage for the following sections.
