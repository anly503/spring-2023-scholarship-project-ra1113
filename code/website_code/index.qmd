# The Data Job Market in the US {#home}



```{python}
#| echo: false

# libraries
from IPython.display import display, HTML, IFrame

```

## Introduction {#introduction}

The job market in the US has been quite unstable recently, with companies, especially technology ones, firing employees left, right and center in order to reduce costs and reduce human power. Furthermore, widespread inflation in the US has led to jobs overpaying several employees, which is another contributing factor to mass layoffs in the technology sector. This project is an attempt to portray a deep dive into the job market in the US, by means of effective data visualizations. We will explore several features of jobs, including their salary, experience, qualifications, and locations, and we will do this in a visually informative manner. For this project, I have chosen a dark and red theme to elucidate the unease and stress experienced around entering the work force. I hope you enjoy my project. 


## What Jobs? Where do they come from?

### Number of Job Results by US State  {#sec-geo-plot-2 .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-geo-2
#| fig-cap: "shows a geospatial map depicting the number of job searches per US state, for which job data is available."

width_percentage = "100%"

```

### Top 5 Cities with their Counts {#sec-bar-plot-1 .unnumbered}
```{python}

```

### Top 5 Search Engines with their Counts {#sec-bar-plot-2 .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-bar-plot-2
#| fig-cap: "shows a bar plot which plots the 5 most frequent job posters, and the number of times they appear in the search."

width_percentage = "100%"

### Top 5 Job Titles with their Counts {#sec-bar-plot-3 .unnumbered}

IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-3.html', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```

### Count of the Search Query, by Degree Required {#sec-grouped-bar-plot .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-grouped-bar-plot
#| fig-cap: "shows a bar plot which plots the search queries, and the number of times they appear based on the degree required."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-4.html', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```


## What do you need? What do you get?

Now, we will explore the average salaries and experience required for data-related jobs, for each state. @fig-interactive-table:

### Table of Average Yearly Pay and Experience Required, by state  {#sec-table .unnumbered}

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-interactive-table
#| fig-cap: "shows an interactive table with a an option to select between average yearly salary and experience required by state."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/table.html', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```

::: {.callout-note}
From the above **interactive data table**, we can gain a better understanding into whether different states look for different levels of experience or pay differing amounts in salaries to employees.
