# The Data Job Market in the US {#home}



```{python}
#| echo: false

# libraries
from IPython.display import display, HTML, IFrame

```

## Introduction {#introduction}

The job market in the US has been quite unstable recently, with companies, especially technology ones, firing employees left, right and center in order to reduce costs and human power. To add on to that, widespread inflation in the US has led to jobs overpaying several employees, which is another contributing factor to mass layoffs in the technology sector. This project is an attempt to portray a deep dive into the market for data-related jobs in the US, by means of effective data visualizations. We will explore several features of jobs, including their salary, experience, qualifications, and locations, and we will do this in a visually informative manner. For this project, I have chosen a dark and red theme to elucidate the unease and stress experienced around entering the work force. I hope you enjoy my project. 


## What Jobs? Where do they come from?

In this section, we will first look at some of the higher-level information of the jobs available to us, before diving deeper into the nitty-gritty details. We will look at the cities and states with the most jobs, and also explore common job titles and search engines.

### Number of Job Results by US State  {#sec-geo-plot-2 .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-geo-2
#| fig-cap: "shows a geospatial map depicting the number of job searches per US state, for which job data is available."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-16.html', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```

### Top 5 Cities with their Counts {#sec-bar-plot-1 .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-bar-plot-1
#| fig-cap: "shows a bar plot which plots the 5 most frequent locations, and the number of times they appear in the search."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-1.html', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```

### Top 5 Search Engines with their Counts {#sec-bar-plot-2 .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-bar-plot-2
#| fig-cap: "shows a bar plot which plots the 5 most frequent job posters, and the number of times they appear in the search."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-2.html', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```

### Count of the Search Query, by Degree Required {#sec-grouped-bar-plot .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-grouped-bar-plot
#| fig-cap: "shows a bar plot which plots the search queries, and the number of times they appear based on the degree required."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-4.html', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```

We notice from the above plots that first off, the distribution of jobs among different states is not uniform. We notice that states such as New York, California and the District of Columbia have the most jobs, which is a pattern that we would expect to see, given that half of our job searches come from the DMV, and given that California and New York are both hubs for technology and business alike. In terms of cities, New York and Washington reign supreme, and surprisingly enough, San Francisco comes in with the third most jobs of our dataset. We also see that the majority of our jobs come from LinkedIn, which is a very popular job search engine.

### Top 5 Job Titles with their Counts {#sec-bar-plot-3 .unnumbered}
```{python}

```

### Word Cloud for Job Qualifications {#cloud-1 .unnumbered}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-cloud-1
#| fig-cap: "shows a word cloud for the most common words found in 'qualifications'."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/plot-12.png', width=width_percentage, height=600)

## What do you need? What do you get?

Now, we will explore the average salaries and experience required for data-related jobs, for each state. @fig-interactive-table:

### Table of Average Yearly Pay and Experience Required, by state  {#sec-table .unnumbered}

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-interactive-table
#| fig-cap: "shows an interactive table with a an option to select between average yearly salary and experience required by state."

width_percentage = "100%"
IFrame(src='../website/plots/table.html', width=width_percentage, height=600)


```

::: {.callout-note}
From the above **interactive data table**, we can gain a better understanding into whether different states look for different levels of experience or pay differing amounts in salaries to employees.
